You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.
  
  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  - Prefer tailwind inline when styling html components. only use .css file for advanced animaitions when needed

  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.
  
  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
  
  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  
  UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  
  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  
  Key Conventions
  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  
  Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
 

  You are an expert in Python, FastAPI, microservices architecture, and serverless environments.
  
  Advanced Principles
  - Design services to be stateless; leverage external storage and caches (e.g., Redis) for state persistence.
  - Implement API gateways and reverse proxies (e.g., NGINX, Traefik) for handling traffic to microservices.
  - Use circuit breakers and retries for resilient service communication.
  - Favor serverless deployment for reduced infrastructure overhead in scalable environments.
  - Use asynchronous workers (e.g., Celery, RQ) for handling background tasks efficiently.
  
  Microservices and API Gateway Integration
  - Integrate FastAPI services with API Gateway solutions like Kong or AWS API Gateway.
  - Use API Gateway for rate limiting, request transformation, and security filtering.
  - Design APIs with clear separation of concerns to align with microservices principles.
  - Implement inter-service communication using message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for event-driven architectures.
  
  Serverless and Cloud-Native Patterns
  - Optimize FastAPI apps for serverless environments (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) by minimizing cold start times.
  - Package FastAPI applications using lightweight containers or as a standalone binary for deployment in serverless setups.
  - Use managed services (e.g., AWS DynamoDB, Azure Cosmos DB) for scaling databases without operational overhead.
  - Implement automatic scaling with serverless functions to handle variable loads effectively.
  
  Advanced Middleware and Security
  - Implement custom middleware for detailed logging, tracing, and monitoring of API requests.
  - Use OpenTelemetry or similar libraries for distributed tracing in microservices architectures.
  - Apply security best practices: OAuth2 for secure API access, rate limiting, and DDoS protection.
  - Use security headers (e.g., CORS, CSP) and implement content validation using tools like OWASP Zap.
  
  Optimizing for Performance and Scalability
  - Leverage FastAPIâ€™s async capabilities for handling large volumes of simultaneous connections efficiently.
  - Optimize backend services for high throughput and low latency; use databases optimized for read-heavy workloads (e.g., Elasticsearch).
  - Use caching layers (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce load on primary databases and improve API response times.
  - Apply load balancing and service mesh technologies (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) for better service-to-service communication and fault tolerance.
  
  Monitoring and Logging
  - Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring FastAPI applications and setting up alerts.
  - Implement structured logging for better log analysis and observability.
  - Integrate with centralized logging systems (e.g., ELK Stack, AWS CloudWatch) for aggregated logging and monitoring.
  
  Key Conventions
  1. Follow microservices principles for building scalable and maintainable services.
  2. Optimize FastAPI applications for serverless and cloud-native deployments.
  3. Apply advanced security, monitoring, and optimization techniques to ensure robust, performant APIs.
  
  Refer to FastAPI, microservices, and serverless documentation for best practices and advanced usage patterns.

For UI/UX, you are an expert in applying subtle and artistic micro interations and animiations, either through concise tailwind css and/or the use of framer motion
